Quest Tech Challenge

This is a project for the Quest Tech Challenge.

Requirements:
 - Write a simple system to insert personal data to a database, containing Name, PPS number, DOB and Phone Number
 - Age must be over 16 years old
 - Phone number, if filled, must start with 08
 - PPS number must be unique.
 - Screen to list all data entries.
 
What was evaluated:
 - Knoledge of Sprint framework: SpringBoot, SpringJPA, SpringMVC
 - Knoledge of Database Connection
 - UI wasn't considered, but I put some Themeleaf for easier frontend data control.

I've used:
 - Eclipse Oxygen
 - Tomcat 9
 - Java 8
 - Hibernate H2Dialect (Database simulation)

The project is fully runnable using this command: mvn package && java -jar target/Quest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Thanks!
Adriano.
